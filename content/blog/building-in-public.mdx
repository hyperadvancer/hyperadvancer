Six months ago, the Longevity Events Calendar was a spreadsheet with 30 rows. Today it's a searchable database of 200+ conferences with AI-enriched metadata on speakers, sponsors, session tracks, and more. Here's what I learned along the way.

## Why build it at all?

I was frustrated. Every time I wanted to find a longevity conference — to attend, to speak at, or to recommend to a client — I had to piece together information from dozens of sources. Event listings were scattered across LinkedIn posts, newsletters, and obscure websites. There was no single, comprehensive source.

So I built one.

## The tech stack

The calendar runs on a deliberately pragmatic stack:

- **Supabase** for the database and API (PostgreSQL under the hood)
- **Next.js** for the frontend
- **Python** for data pipelines and enrichment
- **Claude** for AI-powered classification of speakers, sponsors, and sessions

The key insight was that the value wasn't in the frontend — it was in the data. Getting clean, structured, enriched data about longevity events is genuinely hard. The website is just the interface to that data.

## What I learned about data quality

Data quality is a never-ending battle. Here are some of the challenges:

**Speaker names** come in every conceivable format: "Dr. Jane Smith", "Jane Smith, PhD", "Prof Jane Smith MD", "J. Smith". Normalising these into consistent records required a multi-step pipeline involving fuzzy matching, AI classification, and manual review.

**Event categorisation** is surprisingly subjective. Is a conference on "precision medicine" a longevity event? What about "regenerative medicine"? "Anti-ageing aesthetics"? I ended up building a classification system with clear inclusion criteria, but edge cases still require human judgement.

**Sponsor data** is gold but hard to extract. Event websites bury sponsor logos in image carousels with no alt text or structured data. Extracting and matching these to companies required creative scraping and AI-powered image recognition.

## The unexpected benefit of building in public

The most valuable outcome wasn't the product itself — it was the conversations it started. Sharing the calendar and the data behind it led to conversations with conference organisers, longevity researchers, investors, and fellow builders that I never would have had otherwise.

Building in public creates a virtuous cycle: the more you share, the more people contribute data, corrections, and suggestions. The product gets better, which attracts more users, which generates more feedback.

## What's next

I'm working on a quarterly report that analyses the longevity events landscape — who's speaking, who's sponsoring, what topics are trending, and where the industry is headed. The first edition drops in April 2026.
