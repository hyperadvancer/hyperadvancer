In the rapidly evolving landscape of healthcare and business, a new class of drugs is making waves that extend far beyond the pharmaceutical sector. GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) receptor agonists, initially developed for diabetes management, have emerged as transformative agents in the battle against obesity. According to Trilliant Health, the number of prescriptions for GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic, Mounjaro, and Zepbound surged by 300% in the US between early 2020 and the end of 2022. Predictions from Morgan Stanley suggest nearly 7% of the US population may be using these drugs by 2035.

The implications of these drugs are profound, with patients reporting significant weight loss and reduced risks of heart attacks and strokes. Additionally, GLP-1 drugs may curb cravings for alcohol and nicotine, further enhancing their appeal. 
## What does this mean for businesses across sectors?

**Fitness industry**
The fitness sector is already responding to the rise of GLP-1 users. Gyms are introducing specialised training to address muscle loss and cater to the new fitness needs of users. Life Time, a luxury health club chain, is adopting a multi-faceted approach to appeal to this demographic. Similarly, personal trainers at Equinox and Gold’s Gym SoCal locations are receiving GLP-1-focused instruction. This trend could also positively impact suppliers of gym equipment, wearables, and body composition trackers.
How might your business cater to a clientele that is becoming more fitness-oriented? Offer even more weight or resistance [training](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/02/28/business/gym-exercise-free-weights-cardio/index.html)?
**Food and beverage industry** 
Companies like Nestlé and Abbott are already launching products that target GLP-1 users, emphasising high-protein and weight management foods. The potential impact on fast food consumption remains uncertain: Will these drugs lead to a decrease due to reduced appetite, or an increase as more active lifestyles demand higher caloric intake? The demand for healthier [beverage](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-innovative-functional-beverage-ideas-bart-collet-rlzfe/) alternatives could also see a significant boost from this demographic.
What if the trend towards health-conscious eating accelerates? Will you launch new [products](https://hitconsultant.net/2024/07/17/viome-launches-the-first-personalized-toothpaste-that-supports-whole-body-health-using-biotic-data-ai/), restaurant loyalty [programs](https://www.notboring.co/p/blackbird) or alternative marketing strategies? 
**Aesthetic and medical clinics** 
As users experience rapid weight loss, there is a growing demand for aesthetic procedures, such as facelifts, to address side effects like sagging skin. Unexpected downstream effects, like increased passport renewals due to appearance changes, are emerging.
Could the rise in demand for aesthetic procedures open up new avenues for your business?
**Pharma and hospitals**
Even companies that do not produce GLP-1 drugs can find opportunities. Abbott, for instance, has introduced Protality, a line of shakes designed to support weight loss. Hospitals could offer remote monitoring and virtual consultations to cater to this trend. There's potential for apps integrating food [intake](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/fitterfly-partners-with-google-cloud-to-launch-klik---an-ai-food-cam-feature-to-help-people-with-diabetes-302198911.html), exercise, [nudges](https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/health-tech/teladoc-research-shows-ai-powered-nudges-can-improve-diabetes-members-engagement-health), and medication management.
How could your business leverage this shift? 
**Weight loss programs** 
Weight loss companies like WeightWatchers and Atkins are integrating GLP-1 drugs into their programs, combining medication with healthy lifestyle habits. Atkins is pushing its line of high-protein bars and shakes. This approach could redefine the weight loss industry, blending pharmaceuticals with traditional dietary management.
How might your business model evolve if such lifestyle management becomes the standard?
**Travel** 
Better health and reduced weight could spur interest in more physically demanding activities, impacting the travel industry positively. Adventure tourism, already on the rise, could see even greater growth. Skift Research predicts adventure tour operators might gain an additional $1.3 billion in revenue due to the [GLP-1 effect](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/journey-beyond-traditional-wellness-fitness-bart-collet-qlbte/). Conversely, theme parks and entertainment venues reliant on food and beverage sales might experience a downturn. 
What if consumers shift their spending from traditional leisure activities to more physically demanding experiences? An opportunity for [Airbnb](https://techcrunch.com/2024/08/06/airbnb-details-plans-to-expand-beyond-short-term-rentals-including-co-hosting-and-relaunching-experiences/)?
**Retail and fashion** 
As people lose weight, there’s a noticeable shift in retail, with increased sales in smaller sizes. The demand for fitness apparel and outdoor activity gear is also expected to rise.
Are there opportunities in adaptive [clothing](https://thehustle.co/news/your-tired-legs-can-take-a-hike-motorized-pants-are-here) or personalised fashion in your customer base?

## 3 booster rockets
* The current shortage of GLP-1 drugs is expected to ease as generic versions become available, making these treatments more accessible. Generic versions of Wegovy, Saxenda, Ozempic, and Victoza are set to hit the market soon at a lower cost than the original drugs. Patents for key drugs will soon expire, paving the way for affordable alternatives. 
* LLMs will increase success rates of therapies via hyper-[personalisation](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/too-much-data-human-bart-collet-whdfe/). 
* Social media is also playing a significant role, with users sharing transformative before-and-after stories, further driving interest and adoption.

If GLP-1 drugs prove safe and effective over the long term, and they become cheaper, they could substantially reduce obesity and its associated health problems. That would make a huge difference not only to quality of life but also boost [economic](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/pocket-doctor-revolution-fermi-perspective-bart-collet-xcdpe/) productivity. As business developers and innovators, staying ahead of these trends will be key to navigating the future landscape.
