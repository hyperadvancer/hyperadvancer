title: "Software 2.0 and the doctor fallacy"

excerpt: "What happens when software stops being something we install and becomes something that simply 'appears', adapting to our needs in real time, then dissolving once the task is done? As AI redefines industries, healthcare is next in line."

In an era where software is evolving beyond static applications into fluid, generative experiences, we're witnessing a fundamental shift in how technology serves human needs. Traditional software installation and navigation are giving way to instantaneous, intent-driven tools that materialise when needed and dissolve once their purpose is served. This frictionless computing experience, championed by companies like OpenAI, promises to eliminate app fatigue and streamline our digital interactions. No more struggling to recall where data is stored or which features live in which app: the system identifies our needs in real time and delivers precisely the right capabilities at the right moment. Once the task is completed or the goal is achieved, the system is disassembled.
Imagine applying this concept to healthcare: a perpetually available, AI-driven medical professional in your pocket, offering real-time diagnoses, personalised lifestyle coaching, and therapy support. This vision of on-demand, hyper-contextualised virtual healthcare provides expert medical guidance 24/7, addressing any health question or goal you might have.
But as we edge closer to this reality, a crucial question emerges: will human doctors become obsolete? The answer lies in understanding what economists call 'The Doorman Fallacy'—the mistake of evaluating value solely through the lens of replaceable tasks whilst overlooking intangible benefits. Just as a doorman provides more than mere door-opening services, a doctor's role extends far beyond diagnosing conditions or prescribing treatments.
Consider the less quantifiable aspects of medical care: the reassuring touch during a concerning diagnosis, the intuitive understanding of unspoken fears, or the ability to advocate for patients within complex healthcare systems. These human elements—empathy, ethical judgment, and contextual awareness—form the cornerstone of effective healthcare delivery. While AI can process vast amounts of medical data with remarkable accuracy, it cannot replicate the nuanced understanding that comes from years of human experience and emotional intelligence.
The future of healthcare likely lies not in replacing doctors with AI, but in augmenting human capabilities with powerful technological tools. This partnership could enhance medical care whilst preserving the irreplaceable human elements that make healthcare truly effective. Just as premium establishments maintain doormen for their contribution to customer experience beyond security, the medical profession will continue to value doctors for their ability to heal in ways that transcend pure clinical expertise.
As we embrace the possibilities of generative AI in healthcare, let's avoid the doorman fallacy and instead focus on creating systems that combine the best of both worlds: the efficiency and accessibility of AI with the wisdom, empathy, and human touch that only doctors can provide. The result could be a healthcare system that's not just more advanced, but also more humane.

💥 May this inspire you to advance healthcare beyond its current state of excellence.
