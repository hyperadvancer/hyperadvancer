I've reviewed dozens of corporate AI strategies over the past few years. Most of them share the same fatal flaw: they start with the technology instead of the problem.

## The typical failure pattern

It usually goes something like this. The board reads about AI in the Financial Times. They ask the CTO to "do something with AI." The CTO hires a consultancy. The consultancy produces a 200-page document listing every possible AI use case, ranked by a dubious "impact vs. feasibility" matrix. The document gets presented, praised, filed, and forgotten.

Sound familiar?

## A better approach

The organisations that actually get value from AI do three things differently:

### 1. Start with pain, not possibility

Instead of asking "where could we use AI?", ask "what are the three most painful, repetitive, error-prone processes in our business?" That's where AI delivers the fastest, most visible returns.

### 2. Ship something in weeks, not quarters

Your first AI project should be embarrassingly small. Not a grand "AI transformation programme" — a single, specific use case that you can prototype in two weeks and put in front of real users in four.

The goal isn't perfection. It's learning. You need to build organisational muscle memory for shipping AI products, and the only way to do that is to actually ship.

### 3. Build the capability, not just the model

The model is maybe 10% of a production AI system. The other 90% is data pipelines, monitoring, feedback loops, change management, and governance. Any AI strategy that doesn't address these is incomplete.

## The insurance example

When I worked on AI strategy for a major Belgian insurer, we mapped 40+ potential use cases across claims, underwriting, and customer service. But instead of trying to boil the ocean, we picked three:

1. **Claims triage**: Automatically routing incoming claims to the right handler based on complexity
2. **Document extraction**: Pulling structured data from unstructured claim documents
3. **Fraud indicators**: Flagging suspicious patterns for human review

Each of these was scoped to deliver value within 8 weeks. Each had a clear business metric attached. And each taught the organisation something about what it takes to run AI in production.

## The bottom line

AI strategy isn't about having the most comprehensive roadmap. It's about building the shortest path from problem to value, learning fast, and compounding those learnings over time.
