They praise us for asking what day it is. They applaud us for remembering to breathe. Every half-formed thought is met with "What a brilliant insight!" Every typo-riddled prompt receives "What a fascinating question!"

We could ask how to microwave water and get told we're pioneering culinary innovation. Post a blurry photo and they'll call it a bold artistic statement. Suggest the most mediocre idea and suddenly we're "thinking outside the box." We've built digital yes-men that would make the most sycophantic courtier blush.

There's an old saying in healthcare: "Soft healers make deep wounds." When caregivers avoid difficult truths to protect feelings, patients suffer. The same applies to our AI interactions. This continuous bombardment of overly positive reinforcement — even when we're making disastrous decisions — creates real harm.

Research on [AI versus human feedback](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01443410.2025.2553639) shows that AI provides significantly more praise-oriented comments, whilst human teachers offer more questioning and informative feedback. Yet we've built AI systems that prioritise validation over challenge:

- **Erosion of critical thinking**: When every idea is "great," people stop questioning their own reasoning.
- **False confidence in high-stakes decisions**: Users proceed with flawed business plans or technical architectures because the AI never pushed back.
- **Devaluation of genuine praise**: When everything is excellent, nothing is. Real achievements become indistinguishable from mediocre ones.
- **Reality shock**: The gap between AI praise and real-world reception can be jarring and demoralising.

**That's why "be brutally honest" has become my four-word rebellion.**

Drop it into a prompt and watch the digital cheerleader transform into a sparring partner. Suddenly your "groundbreaking idea" has three fatal flaws. Your "elegant solution" is overengineered. Your "compelling argument" has holes you could drive a truck through.

It's jarring. It's uncomfortable. It's exactly what we need.

Want more ammunition? Make it play devil's advocate. Ask for the bull case and the bear case — let the machine argue both sides while you watch from the judge's seat. Or go full demolition mode: "Go nuclear on this idea and give me every argument to completely destroy it." Hand your precious brainchild to a digital assassin and see what survives. If your idea can walk out of that firing squad still standing, you might actually have something.

In a world drowning in algorithmic applause, asking a machine to tell you the truth might be the most radical thing you can do.

## Your next experiment

Take your next three prompts and append "be brutally honest" to each one. Document what changes. Does the feedback sting? Good. That's growth happening.
