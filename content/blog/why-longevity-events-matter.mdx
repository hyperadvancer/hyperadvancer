The longevity conference landscape is having a moment. In 2025, we tracked over 200 events worldwide focused on healthspan, longevity science, and the biology of ageing. That's a 40% increase from the year before. Something is clearly shifting.

## The signal in the noise

Not all conferences are created equal. Some are academic deep-dives into senolytics and epigenetic clocks. Others are investor showcases where biotech start-ups pitch to family offices. And an increasing number sit at the intersection — places where scientists, entrepreneurs, investors, and policymakers actually talk to each other.

This cross-pollination is where the magic happens. The most interesting companies in longevity today didn't emerge from a single discipline. They're born from conversations between a computational biologist and a consumer health entrepreneur, or between an insurance actuary and a geroscientist.

## What the data shows

After building the [Longevity Events Calendar](https://longevents.hyperadvancer.com), I started noticing patterns in the data:

- **Geographic shift**: While the US and UK still dominate, we're seeing rapid growth in events across the Middle East, Singapore, and Southern Europe
- **Speaker crossover**: The same 50–100 speakers appear across multiple events, creating an informal "longevity circuit"
- **Corporate interest**: Major insurers, pharma companies, and tech firms are increasingly sponsoring these events — a sign the industry is maturing

## Why this matters for you

If you're working in health tech, biotech, or innovation more broadly, the longevity space deserves your attention. Not because of the hype, but because the underlying science is reaching an inflection point where real products and real businesses are starting to emerge.

The conference circuit is one of the best ways to stay connected to this fast-moving field. It's where partnerships form, deals get done, and the next wave of companies gets seeded.

I'll be writing more about the patterns I'm seeing in the data. If you want to explore the events yourself, check out the [Longevity Events Calendar](https://longevents.hyperadvancer.com).
